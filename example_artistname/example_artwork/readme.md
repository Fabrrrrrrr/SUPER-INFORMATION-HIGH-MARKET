# Example

This is an example directory structure for a commit to this pavillon. Please use this structure for organizing the art work. 
The first directory level is your prename and name connected with an undescore 'prename_name'. The next leven is the title of your artwork transformed in the same way (using underscore instead of spaces). 

You can put as much artworks as you want into your directory, but please take care for the metadata. Each artwork needs a thumbnail and a short description in the readme.md file. These files have to be placed in the _meta directory.
