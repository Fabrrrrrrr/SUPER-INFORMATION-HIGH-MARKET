# Example directory structure

## directory name
This is an example directory structure for a commit to this pavillon. Please use this structure for organizing the art work aka superproducts. 
The first directory level is your prename and name connected with an undescore which is 'prename_name'. The next level is the title of your artwork transformed in the same way (using underscore instead of spaces). 

You can put as much artworks as you want into your directory, but please take care for the metadata. Each artwork needs a thumbnail in _meta and a short description in form of a readme.md file in the root directory of the artwork. Just use this example structure and replace.

##index.html
jsut leave the index.html where it is. it prevennts unintended directory listing when placed on webserver. anyway do not care, just leave. :-)
