~In first place a wavefile of "Money Man" by A$AP Mob ft. A$AP Rocky and A$AP Nast was encrypted by WannaCry ransomware on an infected Windows machine. 
(encrypted data can be found '/_audio/A$AP-Mob-Ft.-A$AP-Rocky-A$AP-Nast-Money-Man.wav.WNCRY' - use this to create your 
own rans0mMus1c or related projects)~

~The encrypted *.WNCRY file was reinterpreted as raw GSM audio @133700Hz and monob video @92x64p, upscaled to 640x480 *.mp4 file with ffmpeg.~
The encrypted *.WNCRY file was reinterpreted as raw GSM audio @1337Hz and uyvy422 video @6x6p, upscaled to 640x480 *.avi file with ffmpeg.
Different approaches can be done by applying other meta-information to encrypted data-files as raw audo- and video-streams.

A reduced quality version of the resulting video can be found as a release of this project.
