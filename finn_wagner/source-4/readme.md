Titel : untitled 

This work deals with the relation and dependance between an object and its surface. Normally a 3D-texture is a picture which is wrapped around a volume and its position is given by coordinates. These pictures used as textures are not made for the human perception. Itâ€™s a technical image which first has to be transformed into the virtual and three-dimensional room to fit to the human perception of objects. 
The textures in this work are not bonded on its object, they have its own physical behavior and become independent objects themselves.
