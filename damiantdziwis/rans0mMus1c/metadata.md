# rans0mMus1c

## making visul music with ransomware. 

### process notes:

In first place a wavefile of "Money Man" by A$AP Mob ft. A$AP Rocky and A$AP Nast was encrypted by WannaCry ransomware. 
(encrypted data can be found '/_audio/A$AP-Mob-Ft.-A$AP-Rocky-A$AP-Nast-Money-Man.wav.WNCRY' - use this to create your 
own rans0mMus1c or related projects) 

The encrypted *.WNCRY file was reinterpreted as raw GSM audio @133700Hz and monob video @92x64p, upscaled to 640x480 *.mp4 file with ffmpeg.
Different approaches can be done by applying other meta-information to encrypted data-files as raw audo- and video-streams.

A reduced quality version of the resulting video can be found as a release of this project.
