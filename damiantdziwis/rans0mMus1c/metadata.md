The coming up of ransomware and especially recently one of the most prominent, WannaCry, 
let people question the value of their digital data by encrypting it and let them pay to get it back.

In rans0mMus1c the encryption by this malicious software becomes a creative process by reinterpreting encrypted pieces 
of Pop- and Entertainment Music as audio- and videodata resulting in a new piece of visual music.

A linked crowdfunding campaign allows it, in case it raises enough money, 
to free the original music piece from its blackmailer and to decrypt it back to the original.
