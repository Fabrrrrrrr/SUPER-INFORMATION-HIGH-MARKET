# rans0mMus1c

The coming up of ransomware and especially recently one of the most prominent, WannaCry, 
let people question the value of their digital data by encrypting it and let them pay to get it back.

In rans0mMus1c the encryption by this malicious software becomes a creative process by reinterpreting encrypted audio-files 
of pop- and entertainment-music as audio- and videodata resulting in a new piece of visual music.
This is done at first place with a audio-file of "Money Man" by A$AP Mob ft. A$AP Rocky and A$AP Nast.
See [metadata](metadata.md) for detailed description of the process. 

A linked crowdfunding campaign allows it, in case it raises enough money, to pay the demanded ransom in bitcoin in order
to free the original music piece from its blackmailer and to decrypt the source audio-file back to its original state.
