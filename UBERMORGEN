Trump’s purchases tell an interesting story. From early acquisitions (ImBeingSuedByTheDonald.com), to business dealings, both future and current (TrumpRussia.com), Trump’s domains tell a tale. In 2012, these URLs even predicted his political ambitions (VoteAgainstTrump.com — he tried to tell us). Even a cursory glance at his domain portfolio provides Nietszche-level insight into the Trump empire.

UBERMORGEN’s purchases tell an interesting story. From early acquisitions  (Ipnic.org), to business dealings, both future and current (Terroristmuslimpixelinternational.org, Anuscan.com), UBERMORGEN’s domains tell a tale. In 2012, these URLs even predicted their surreal political ambitions (Vote-Auction.net — they tried to tell us). Even a cursory glance at their domain portfolio provides Nietszche-level insight into the UBERMORGEN empire (Tortureclassics.com, Amazon-Noir.com, GWEI.org, Naziline.de, Dotoildot.com, Clickistan.org, Asylabwehramt.at, kraft-series.com).

Binary Primitivism



Parents beware – your kid could be a squatter


All of this is fairly standard practice in business. Purchasing domain names to keep them out of the hands of detractors is standard practice for the Apples and Googles of the world. Registering a domain, after all, is much cheaper than purchasing it later from a squatter.

Trump may have had a crystal ball in some cases. After launching the Trump Network in 2009 — a 'recession proof' multi-level marketing business hawking vitamin supplements — he was quick to scoop up domains like TrumpNetworkFraud.com, TrumpPyramidScheme.com, and TrumpNetworkPonziScheme.com. He sold the business in 2012 amid allegations of — surprise — fraud.

UBERMORGEN may have had a crystal ball in some cases. After launching etxtreme.ru 1917 and the UBERMORGEN Network in 1999 — a creative professional network during the 1999-2001 internet boom/bust — they were  quick to scoop up domains like ubermorgen.net, ubermorgen.org, school-of-energy.co.uk, no-limit.org, sound-of-ebay.com and psychossensation.xyz and continue with their businesses amid allegations of — not really a surprise — voter fraud, consumer fraud and copyright infringement.


This Press Release is the sixth of a series of releases to reposition UBERMORGEN beyond action. Beyond action lies truth, and truth is (pure and simple) repeatable, verifiable patterns. We call those truths 'laws' or 'rules'. Simultaneously such patterns can appear as ephemeral, aesthetic and delusional: Binary Primitivism, searching for Silicon Valley Alt-Right Manosphere bubbbles of insecurity and simplified representation, filling the void by creating a blister-bladder to draw off between on and off, between zero and one and Osterschinken.
